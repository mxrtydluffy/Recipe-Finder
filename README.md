## About Rapid Recipes

Rapid Recipes uses the [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api) to find recipes according to your search by recipe or ingredient.
Searching for a recipe is fast and easy with a simple interface free of distracting advertisements.
To use Rapid Recipes, type a search query, and a selection of results is shown. By clicking the view recipe button, you are taken to the full recipe on an external site.
Save time by finding your next recipe using Rapid Recipes!
